# Challenge Problem 5

## Deadline: March 24, 2023 by midnight

Note: While high-level discussion is allowed and encouraged for the challenge problems, these problems should be completed and submitted individually.

### Description

Run through the guide at [RNN guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn). Then, answer the following questions.

### Part 1: Keras

1.   Give 1-2 sentence description of keras.

Keras is used to  build recurrent models without having to make difficult configuration choices.

2.   Give a short explanation of the following:

- `Embedding`
Embedding is a process where the learned data is put into a variable

-  `Dropout` 
Dropout is used to remove overfitting data. Overfitting is when the training data goes against the programs model. That can lead to the
AI not working properly and giving weird results.



### Part 2: Unidirectional vs Bidirectional

1.   Give 2-3 sentence explanation of how bidirectional RNNs are different from unidirectional RNNs.

Bidirectional Rnns can help predict the next word in a sentence by looking at the other words surronding the current word. Unidirectional will only look
at the words ahead.

### Part 3: Add code

1.   Include the code from "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Keras" guide that you ran (must show output) as a Google Colab notebook in your challenge 5 repository.

Added.
